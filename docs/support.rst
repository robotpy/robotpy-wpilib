Support
=======

The RobotPy project was started in 2010, and since then the community
surrounding RobotPy has continued to grow! If you have questions about how
to do something with RobotPy, you can ask questions in the following locations:

* `RobotPy mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/robotpy>`_
* `ChiefDelphi Python Forums <http://www.chiefdelphi.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?f=187>`_

We have found that most problems users have are actually questions generic to
WPILib-based languages like C++/Java, so searching around the ChiefDelphi forums
could be useful if you don't have a python-specific question. 

During the FRC build season, you can probably expect answers to your questions
within a day or two if you send messages to the mailing list. As community members
are also members of FRC teams, you can expect that the closer we get to the end of
the build season, the harder it will be for community members to respond to your
questions!

Reporting Bugs
--------------

If you run into a problem with RobotPy that you think is a bug, or perhaps there
is something wrong with the documentation or just too difficult to do, please
feel free to file bug reports on the `github issue tracker <https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-wpilib/issues>`_.
Someone should respond within a day or two, especially during the FIRST
build season.

Contributing new fixes or features
----------------------------------

RobotPy is intended to be a project that all members of the FIRST community can
**quickly** and **easily** contribute to. If you find a bug, or have an idea that you
think others can use:

1. `Fork this git repository <https://github.com/robotpy/robotpy-wpilib/fork>`_ to your github account
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push -u origin my-new-feature`)
5. Create new Pull Request on github

Github has a lot of documentation about `forking repositories <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo>`_
and `pull requests <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`_,
so be sure to check out those resources.

IRC
---

During the FRC Build Season, some RobotPy developers may be able to be reached on
**#robotpy** channel on `Freenode <http://freenode.net/irc_servers.shtml>`_. 

.. note:: the channel is not very active, but if you stick around for a day or two
          someone will probably answer your question -- think in terms of email
          response time
          
          The channel tends to be most active between 11pm and 1am EST.
