dedicated to developing python-related projects for the FIRST Robotics
Competition.

Installation to Robot
=====================

The RobotPy installation process is intended to be quick and painless. Follow
these steps and you'll be on your way!

* Install Python 3.x (latest is always recommended)
* Extract this zipfile somewhere
* Run one of the following:

	Windows:   py installer.py install-robotpy
	
	Linux/OSX: python3 installer.py install-robotpy

Once you answer the questions, your robot has the necessary files to start
running python robot code! Our documentation site (see above) can help you get
started writing your code.

The RobotPy installer can install other python packages and binary packages on
your robot. See the RobotPy documentation for more details.
